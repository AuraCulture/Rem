# Platform Notes: Windows vs Unix

## Unix/Linux/macOS
- The `rem` command works out of the box in **Bash**, **Zsh**, and other shells.  
- No naming conflicts; just use `rem` as shown above.  

## Windows
- In **PowerShell**, `rem` works as expected.  
- In **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)**, `rem` is a built-in command for comments, which can cause conflicts.  
- If you encounter issues in Command Prompt, use **PowerShell** or run with full path "C:\Users\your_pc_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts\rem.exe" image_name
